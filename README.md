Full-stack Django Rest Framework and React Ecommerce application. Used REST APIs for the backend along with JWT Token Authentication to securely handle user data. Made a search feature to allow users to easily find items. Utilized React Router to do client-side routing, enhancing the applications smoothness and responsiveness. User data is stored in a SQLite database for quick and easy access. Styling was implemented using Tailwind CSS, and Redux was utilized for efficient state management.
